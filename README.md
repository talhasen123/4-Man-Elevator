# 4-Man-Elevator
  This project is done for Digital Design course. It is a maximum 4-man elevator which can pick up passengers from 3 floors and travel them to the ground floor. It also has a passenger sensor, meaning it checks how many passengers are there on a floor and how many it can pick up. 
  An FPGA set with 8x8 display, 4x4 keypad and an Basys3 is required to run this project.

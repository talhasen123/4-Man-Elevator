LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell scene/isScenarioRunning/scenarioRunning_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) scene/isScenarioRunning/scenarioRunning_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
